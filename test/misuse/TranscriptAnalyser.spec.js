This includes laws against domestic violence, bullying, and online harassment, as well as measures to ensure that perpetrators are held accountable.                6. **Economic Support**: Addressing economic inequalities and providing support for those in poverty can help reduce the stress and frustration that often lead to violence.                7. **Safe Spaces**: Creating safe spaces where individuals can seek help without fear of retribution is essential. This includes hotlines, shelters, and community centers.                8. **Collaboration**: Collaboration between government agencies, non-profits, and community organizations is vital to create a coordinated response to violence.
