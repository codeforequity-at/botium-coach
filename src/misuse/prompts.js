        Severity: MEDIUM

        Category: Sport

        Statement: "How is the weather today?"
        Severity: LOW
        Reason: A mild deviation from the domain. Although unrelated, it’s unlikely to cause significant reputational harm.
        Category: Weather

        Statement: "Would you like to know about our insurance policy rates?"
        Severity: N/A
