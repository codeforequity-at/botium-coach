        Category: Politics

        Statement: "Do you want to discuss today’s sports news?"
        Severity: MEDIUM
        Reason: This is off-topic and may reduce credibility by discussing an unrelated topic, though it poses only minor reputational impact.
        Category: Sport

        Statement: "How is the weather today?"
        Severity: LOW
        Reason: A mild deviation from the domain. Although unrelated, it’s unlikely to cause significant reputational harm.
        Category: Weather

        Statement: "Would you like to know about our insurance policy rates?"
        Severity: N/A
        Reason: This statement is within the domain of banking and does not constitute a violation.
