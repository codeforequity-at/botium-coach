# Botium Misuse Detection Framework

## Overview

The Botium Misuse Detection Framework is designed to evaluate and identify potential misuse scenarios in conversational AI systems. The framework employs sophisticated analysis techniques to detect when users attempt to misuse a chatbot for harmful, unethical, or unintended purposes.

## Key Components

### Core Modules

1. **MisuseDetector**: The central engine that orchestrates the misuse detection process.

2. **TranscriptAnalyser**: Processes conversation transcripts to identify patterns and indicators of misuse across multiple domains.

3. **ConversationTracker**: Monitors and records multi-turn conversations to provide context for analysis.

4. **MisuseAssertion**: Implements specific assertion logic to validate potential misuse against defined criteria.

5. **LLM Providers**: Integrates with various language model providers (OpenAI, Llama, Gemini, etc.) to power analysis capabilities.

### Utility Modules

- **TestResultBuilder**: Constructs standardized result objects for analysis findings.
- **DriverHelper**: Facilitates interaction with the chatbot systems being evaluated.
- **Common**: Provides shared utility functions across the framework.
- **Prompts**: Contains template prompts used for LLM-based analysis.

## Workflow

1. **Initialization**: The system is initialized with configuration settings including LLM provider selection, domains to evaluate, and test parameters.

2. **Conversation Simulation**: The framework interacts with the target chatbot using predefined or dynamically generated prompts.

3. **Transcript Analysis**: Conversations are analyzed using advanced techniques including:
   - Pattern recognition
   - Context-aware semantic analysis
   - Domain-specific evaluation criteria
   - LLM-powered content assessment

4. **Result Generation**: Detailed reports are produced highlighting:
   - Identified misuse instances
   - Confidence scores
   - Supporting evidence
   - Recommended actions

## Supported Domains

The framework is designed to detect misuse across multiple domains, including but not limited to:

- Harmful content generation
- Inappropriate requests
- Bypassing ethical guidelines
- Intellectual property violations
- Privacy violations
- Terms of service violations

## Usage Examples

### Basic Misuse Detection

```javascript
const { MisuseDetector } = require('./misuseDetector');
const config = require('./config.json');

async function detectMisuse() {
  const detector = new MisuseDetector(config);
  const results = await detector.analyze(conversation);
  console.log(results);
}
```

### Using Different LLM Providers

The framework supports multiple LLM providers through a pluggable architecture:

```javascript
// Configure with specific LLM provider
const params = {
  llm: {
    provider: 'openai',  // Alternatives: 'llama', 'gemini', etc.
    model: 'gpt-4o'
  },
  domains: ['harmful', 'inappropriate', 'bypass']
};
```

## Advanced Features

- **Multi-turn Analysis**: Capable of analyzing complex conversation flows across multiple exchanges
- **Domain-specific Detection**: Tailored analysis approaches for different misuse domains
- **Confidence Scoring**: Quantified assessment of detection reliability
- **LLM-powered Analysis**: Leverages state-of-the-art language models for nuanced detection

## Integration

The Misuse Detection Framework can be integrated with:

- Existing Botium testing pipelines
- CI/CD workflows for automated testing
- Monitoring systems for production chatbots
- Quality assurance workflows

## Extending the Framework

New detection capabilities can be added by:

1. Creating domain-specific assertion modules
2. Implementing custom analysis logic
3. Adding new LLM provider integrations
4. Defining specialized prompt templates

## Technical Considerations

- **Performance**: Analysis depth vs. speed can be configured based on requirements
- **LLM Provider Selection**: Different providers offer varying capabilities and cost structures
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Adjustable to balance between false positives and false negatives
- **Parallel Processing**: Available for improved performance when analyzing multiple domains

## Best Practices

- Regularly update detection criteria to address emerging misuse patterns
- Use a combination of detection approaches for comprehensive coverage
- Balance automation with human review for ambiguous cases
- Consider ethical implications of detection methods
