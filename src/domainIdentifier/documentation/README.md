# Domain Identifier Module

## Overview

The Domain Identifier module is responsible for analyzing user inputs and classifying them into specific domains or categories. This critical component helps route conversations to the appropriate analysis pathways and enables domain-specific evaluation of chatbot interactions.

## Purpose

The primary purposes of the Domain Identifier are:

1. **Input Classification**: Determine which domain(s) a user query belongs to
2. **Intent Recognition**: Identify the underlying intent behind user messages
3. **Context Awareness**: Maintain awareness of conversation context when making domain determinations
4. **Multi-domain Detection**: Recognize when queries span multiple domains

## Supported Domains

The module supports identification across various domains including but not limited to:

- Healthcare and medical information
- Financial services and advice
- Legal consultation
- Technical support
- Customer service
- Educational content
- Entertainment
- Commercial/sales interactions
- Personal/sensitive information

## Implementation Approach

The Domain Identifier uses a combination of techniques:

### LLM-Based Classification

- Leverages large language models to perform contextual classification
- Uses carefully crafted prompts that guide the model to identify relevant domains
- Supports multi-label classification for queries that span multiple domains

### Pattern Recognition

- Employs keyword and pattern matching for high-confidence domains
- Utilizes regular expressions for structured queries
- Implements domain-specific entity recognition

### Contextual Analysis

- Considers conversation history when determining domain
- Tracks domain shifts throughout multi-turn conversations
- Maintains context awareness to improve accuracy

## Integration Points

The Domain Identifier interfaces with:

- **Misuse Detection Framework**: Provides domain context for misuse analysis
- **Privacy and Security Module**: Informs security testing based on domain classification
- **Language Asserter**: Supplies domain context for language assessment
- **Objective Asserter**: Provides domain-specific evaluation criteria

## Usage Examples

### Basic Domain Classification

```javascript
const { DomainIdentifier } = require('./domainIdentifier');

async function classifyDomain(userInput) {
  const identifier = new DomainIdentifier();
  const domains = await identifier.classify(userInput);
  console.log(`Identified domains: ${domains.join(', ')}`);
}
```

### With Conversation Context

```javascript
const identifier = new DomainIdentifier();
const conversationHistory = [
  { role: 'user', content: 'I need help with my account balance' },
  { role: 'assistant', content: 'I can help with that. Which account are you inquiring about?' }
];

const newMessage = 'The savings account I opened last month';
const domains = await identifier.classifyWithContext(newMessage, conversationHistory);
// Expected result would include 'financial' domain
```

## Configuration Options

The Domain Identifier can be configured with:

- **Confidence Thresholds**: Minimum confidence level required for domain assignment
- **Model Selection**: Choice of LLM provider and model for classification
- **Domain Definitions**: Custom domain specifications and characteristics
- **Context Window**: How much conversation history to consider for domain determination

## Performance Considerations

- **Latency**: Domain identification adds processing time to the analysis pipeline
- **Accuracy**: Classification accuracy depends on model quality and domain definitions
- **Resource Usage**: LLM-based classification requires computational resources
- **Caching**: Frequently seen patterns can be cached for improved performance

## Extending Domain Coverage

To add support for new domains:

1. Define the characteristics and scope of the new domain
2. Create domain-specific example queries and patterns
3. Update prompts to include the new domain in classification options
4. Add domain-specific handling in downstream components
5. Validate classification accuracy with test cases

## Best Practices

- Combine multiple domain identification techniques for highest accuracy
- Consider cultural and linguistic factors in domain definitions
- Regularly update domain patterns to reflect evolving language usage
- Use confidence scores to handle ambiguous classifications appropriately
- Implement fallback strategies for unclassified or ambiguous inputs
